Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very
acceptable performance.  It has no dependencies except ones which live in the
Python standard library.  It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python
2.6+ and Python 3.2+.  It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0+ on UNIX.  It
supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

For more information, see the "docs" directory of the Waitress package or

0.9.0 (2016-04-15)
------------------

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.2 is no longer supported by Waitress.

- Python 2.6 will no longer be supported by Waitress in future releases.

Security/Protections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Building on the changes made in pull request 117, add in checking for line
  feed/carriage return HTTP Response Splitting in the status line, as well as
  the key of a header. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/124 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/122.

- Waitress will no longer accept headers or status lines with
  newline/carriage returns in them, thereby disallowing HTTP Response
  Splitting. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/117 for
  more information, as well as
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- FileBasedBuffer and more important ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer no longer report
  False when tested with bool(), instead always returning True, and becoming
  more iterator like.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/82 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/76

- Call prune() on the output buffer at the end of a request so that it doesn't
  continue to grow without bounds. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/111 for more information.
